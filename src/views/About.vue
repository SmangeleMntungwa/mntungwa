            RESEARCH AND DATA ALONE ARE NOT ENOUGH. To achieve our mission and
            bring our vision to life, it is critical that we look at the problem
            holistically. We have identified four interconnected strategic
            pillars to give focus to the various roles we play:<br />

            WE INSPIRE governments, global policymakers, businesses, and
            individuals to take action.
            <br />
            WE RESEARCH in pursuit of scientific data on threatened species and
            critical marine habitats.
            <br />
            WE EDUCATE global and local communities to create and empower ocean
            guardians to develop long-term conservation solutions.
            <br />
            WE PROTECT marine life and their critical habitats by developing
            effective, sustainable conservation strategies.
            <br />
            WE GIVE our profits made from the onsite store and donations to help
            bring cleaner seas and better living environment for marine life.
